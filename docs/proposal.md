### Summary of the Project 
Our project is a Space Invaders game simulation in Minecraft. The goal of the game is to kill all of the aliens before they cross an “invasion line”. As the player progresses, the aliens move forward faster and shoot at the player more rapidly. The goal of our project is for the AI to learn how to kill the aliens without getting killed and before they “invade”. The input is the space invaders location, how many are left to kill, the distance between the player, the closest aliens to the invasion line, and where the aliens will shoot back. The output is where the agent will shoot and the location it will move to. The job of the AI is to determine which alien is the best one to kill and how to move to the position without getting shot. It should consider the cost of moving to each position before it decides which one to go to.
