CrossyCarts is a Minecraft AI agent that plays a modified version of the games Crossy Road™ and Frogger™. In this version, the goal is to get on minecarts and get off of them at the right time in order to safely cross the tracks instead of avoiding cars or hopping onto moving logs.

Our AI will be using Q-tabular reinforcement learning in order to solve this problem
